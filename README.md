# Fish-Classification
In this study, a balanced dataset containing 9 different fish species was used to train an artificial neural network (ANN). 
During the training, 7 different model architectures were tested, and the model that performed the best among them was retrained with the entire dataset as the final model.

The training process initially started with a simple architecture, and in subsequent steps, dropout, batch normalization, image generators, and different optimizers were tested in various architectures to prevent overfitting and achieve more accurate results.

As a result, the final model we trained achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.99.
